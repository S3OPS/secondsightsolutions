# Copilot Instructions

A Lord of the Rings-themed guide for AI-assisted development.

## 1. Directives: The Command of the King

These are your "Action Verbs." They tell the AI exactly how to treat the "mission" (the code).

- **Optimize**: "Make the journey faster." Don't take the long way around the mountain; use the Great Eagles.
- **Refactor**: "Clean up the camp." Keep the same mission, but organize the supplies so they aren't a mess.
- **Modularize**: "Break up the Fellowship." Instead of one giant group, give Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli their own specific tasks so they can work better separately.
- **Audit**: "Inspect the ranks." Look through the code to find any hidden Orcs (security flaws) or traitors.

## 2. Automation Frameworks: Choosing Your Fellowship

You wouldn't send a Hobbit to do a Wizard's job. These "Frameworks" are the specific tools or "characters" best suited for the terrain.

- **Cypress/Playwright**: These are like Legolas—fast, modern, and incredibly accurate for scouting (testing) the path ahead.
- **Selenium**: This is like Treebeard—an older, powerful Ent. He's a bit slower and heavier, but he knows every corner of the ancient forest.
- **GitHub Actions**: This is like the Beacon of Gondor. It's the system that automatically signals the next step: "The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for a code deployment!"

## 3. Architecture & Logic: The Map and the Strategy

This is how the fellowship is organized so they don't walk into a trap.

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: This is like having a Map of Middle-earth. Instead of saying "turn left at the big rock," you define "Helm's Deep" once. If the fortress moves, you only update the map in one place.
- **Error Handling**: "What if the bridge collapses?" This tells the code what to do if a Balrog appears so the whole program doesn't just die.
- **Async/Await**: "Wait for my signal." This ensures Gandalf doesn't try to arrive at the gate before he's actually finished riding from Rohan.

## 4. Constraint Phrases: The "One Ring" Rules

These are the strict "Don'ts." Power can corrupt a script, making it too bloated and heavy to carry.

- **"Do NOT add extra features"**: "Just take the Ring to the fire." Don't stop to liberate every village in Middle-earth; we are on a schedule.
- **"Keep existing logic intact"**: "Don't change the prophecy." Use what we already have without rewriting the history books.
- **"Avoid deprecated APIs"**: "Don't use the old magic." Don't use tools from the First Age that no longer work in the Third Age.
